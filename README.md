# docsync-frontend


Here’s a **week-by-week breakdown** for completing your **real-time collaboration tool (Google Editor)** project within your time frame. The plan is structured to focus on incremental development, ensuring a functional application by the end.

---

### **Week 1: Project Setup and Basic Authentication**
**Goals**:
- Set up the project infrastructure.
- Implement user authentication with JWT.

**Tasks**:
1. **Frontend**:
   - Initialize the React project (use Vite or CRA).
   - Set up routing using `react-router-dom`.
   - Create UI for login and signup pages.
   - Install libraries: `axios` (API requests), `zustand`/`redux` (state management).

2. **Backend**:
   - Initialize the NestJS project with modular structure.
   - Set up MongoDB (or PostgreSQL) and connect it to the backend.
   - Implement authentication:
     - REST API for signup, login, and fetching user details.
     - JWT-based token authentication with protected routes.

3. **Deployment**:
   - Dockerize both the frontend and backend for consistent environments.
   - Set up RabbitMQ locally or in Docker to test messaging.

**Deliverables**:
- Functional login/signup flow.
- Protected routes using JWT.
- Dockerized frontend and backend.

### **Week 2: Document Management (CRUD Operations)**
**Goals**:
- Enable users to create, view, edit, and delete documents.
- Set up the basic structure for document storage.

**Tasks**:
1. **Frontend**:
   - Create a dashboard to display all user documents.
   - Add functionality for creating and editing documents with a simple textarea.
   - Add options to delete documents.

2. **Backend**:
   - Define a `Document` schema:
     - Fields: title, content, owner (user ID), timestamps.
   - Implement CRUD APIs:
     - `GET /documents`: Fetch user’s documents.
     - `POST /documents`: Create a new document.
     - `GET /documents/:id`: Fetch a specific document.
     - `PUT /documents/:id`: Update document content.
     - `DELETE /documents/:id`: Delete a document.

3. **Testing**:
   - Test CRUD operations manually via Postman or a similar tool.

**Deliverables**:
- CRUD operations for documents are functional on both frontend and backend.

### **Week 3: Real-Time Collaboration Setup**
**Goals**:
- Enable real-time editing with WebSocket communication.

**Tasks**:
1. **Frontend**:
   - Integrate WebSocket with `socket.io-client` or the native WebSocket API.
   - Establish WebSocket connections when a user opens a document.
   - Broadcast document changes to other connected users.

2. **Backend**:
   - Set up a WebSocket server using `@nestjs/websockets`.
   - Define events for:
     - User connecting/disconnecting.
     - Broadcasting document updates.
   - Ensure document edits are synchronized across clients.

3. **RabbitMQ Integration**:
   - Queue WebSocket updates in RabbitMQ to handle scaling scenarios.

**Deliverables**:
- Real-time editing is functional, with multiple users able to see changes live.

---

### **Week 4: Conflict Resolution and Collaboration Enhancements**
**Goals**:
- Implement conflict resolution.
- Add real-time indicators for collaborators.

**Tasks**:
1. **Conflict Resolution**:
   - Implement **Operational Transform (OT)** or **Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDT)** to handle simultaneous edits.

2. **Frontend Enhancements**:
   - Display live cursors for collaborators with different colors.
   - Add "User X is typing" indicators.

3. **Backend Enhancements**:
   - Optimize WebSocket performance for multiple collaborators.
   - Handle role-based permissions (owner, editor, viewer).

**Deliverables**:
- Conflict resolution implemented.
- Collaborator indicators are visible in real time.

---

### **Week 5: Version History and Export Options**
**Goals**:
- Implement document versioning.
- Add options to export documents as PDF or Markdown.

**Tasks**:
1. **Version History**:
   - Save document snapshots after significant edits or at regular intervals.
   - Create a backend API to fetch version history.
   - Add a frontend interface to view and restore previous versions.

2. **Export Options**:
   - Backend:
     - Add functionality to export documents as PDF (use libraries like `pdfkit` or Puppeteer).
     - Add Markdown export support.
   - Frontend:
     - Add export buttons and link them to backend APIs.

**Deliverables**:
- Document versioning and export functionality.

---

### **Week 6: Testing, Deployment, and Final Polish**
**Goals**:
- Ensure the application is robust and deployable.
- Optimize for performance and user experience.

**Tasks**:
1. **Testing**:
   - Write unit tests for frontend components (Jest, React Testing Library).
   - Write unit tests for backend APIs and WebSocket handlers.
   - Conduct end-to-end tests using Cypress.

2. **Deployment**:
   - Use Docker to containerize the application.
   - Deploy on a cloud platform (AWS, Google Cloud, or Vercel for the frontend).
   - Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

3. **Optimization**:
   - Improve frontend performance (e.g., lazy loading, minimizing WebSocket re-renders).
   - Add meaningful error handling and feedback (e.g., handling WebSocket disconnections).

4. **Polish**:
   - Refine the UI/UX for better usability.
   - Add any stretch features like commenting, notifications, or dark mode.

**Deliverables**:
- Fully tested and deployed real-time collaboration tool.

### **Tips for Success**:
1. **Use Git**: Create feature branches for every milestone to maintain a clean history.
2. **Daily Goals**: Break each week’s tasks into smaller daily goals to stay on track.
3. **Focus on MVP**: Complete the core features first; additional features can be added if time permits.
